The dataset for this challenge contains a sample of usersâ€™ page views and clicks, as observed on multiple publisher sites in the United States between 14-June-2016 and 28-June-2016. Each viewed page or clicked recommendation is further accompanied by some semantic attributes of those documents.   The dataset contains numerous sets of content recommendations served to a specific user in a specific context. Each context (i.e. a set of recommendations) is given a display_id. In each such set, the user has clicked on at least one recommendation. The identities of the clicked recommendations in the test set are not revealed. Your task is to rank the recommendations in each group by decreasing predicted likelihood of being clicked.  Each user in the dataset is represented by a unique id (uuid). A person can view a document (document_id), which is simply a web page with content (e.g.  a news article). On each document, a set of ads (ad_id) are displayed. Each ad belongs to a campaign (campaign_id) run by an advertiser (advertiser_id). You are also provided metadata about the document, such as which entities are mentioned, a taxonomy of categories, the topics mentioned, and the publisher.  For this case, we will doing exploratory data analysis, data merging and machine learning from 5 datasets: page_views.csv, events.csv, click_train.csv, promoted_contents.csv and documents_meta.csv.
